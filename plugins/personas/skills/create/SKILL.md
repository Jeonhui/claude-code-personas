description: Create a new Claude Code profile with isolated configuration
---

Create a new Claude Code profile. The profile name must use only letters, numbers, hyphens, and underscores.

Run:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/dist/index.js" create $ARGUMENTS
```

After creation, suggest switching to the new profile with `/personas:switch`.
